# Moralis Notes

## Web 3 API
Moralis has a rest API. You can copy an API key from https://admin.moralis.io/web3Api# (button up the top) and then execute them in CURL. 
However, you're not supposed to do this from your front end because you'd be sharing your key with the public. 
This video show how to create a Cloud Function in Moralis which has your key in it and which you can call from the front end.
